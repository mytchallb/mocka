# Mocka

An app I'm building with Expresss, Svelte, Vite and Tailwind, to quickly mock up UI's for websites using a library of skeleton templates.

Note: Still in early concept stages.

## Running the app

After creating the Svelte app, build it with `npm run build`

Start the express server with `npm run apidev`

Generate image from component
